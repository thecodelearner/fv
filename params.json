If the money earns interest at 'i' percent per annum, calculate how much money will be accumulated after 'n' years based on interest rate and the frequency with which the interest 'i' is compounded (Annually / Semi-annually / Monthly /  Quarterly).\r\n\r\n**References**\r\n\r\n\r\n<img src=\"\\images\\fval1.png\"  alt=\"Annual\" class=\"inline\"/>\r\n\r\n```\r\nWhere: \r\n    F = Future Accumulation\r\n    A = Amount (money) deposited each month\r\n    i = Annual interest rate (in decimals)\r\n    m = Number of compounding periods per year\r\n    Where:\r\n        m = 1 //for Annual compounding\r\n        m = 2 //for semi-annual compounding\r\n        m = 4 // for quarterly compounding\r\n        m = 12 //for monthly compounding\r\n```\r\n",
